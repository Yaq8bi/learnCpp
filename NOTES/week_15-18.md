# ComProtocol
- [1] (Ortak bir protocol, e.g anlasmak icin bir dil) [2]

Serial: bit by bit, sequenial,  daha yavas. Single wire. Used for long distances.
---
Paralel: Ayni anda birden fazla bit gonderioyor. Faster than serial; has risks due to the cables having different delays.

Paralel often  used in PCB, but even a sharp turned cable might act as a antenna and cause interference, due to electromagnetic interference.
- Crosstalk is also a big problem.
- Expensive(cable, wire)
- Used for short distances.

# 2 Serial
### Synchronous and Asynchronous
- Sync comunication: a clock signal is used to synchronize the sender and receiver.
- Async communication: no clock signal is used. Instead, the sender and receiver agree on a specific baud rate (bits per second) and use start and stop bits to indicate the beginning and end of each byte of data.

# 3 OSI model.

- PDNTA
- Physical: Cables, wires.
- Data link: MAC address, Frames, CRC checksum.
- Network: IP Address, packets, ARP, ICMP, OSPF.
- Transport: TCP, UDP.
- Application:  Telnet, SSH, HTTP, FTP, SMTP.
