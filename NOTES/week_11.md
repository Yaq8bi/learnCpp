```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <mutex>
#include <condition_variable>
#include <thread>

// Template declaration allows this stack to work with any data type (T)
// and with a fixed maximum size (Size). Using a template makes it more reusable.
template <typename T, size_t Size>
class ThreadSafeStack {
public:
    // Constructor: Initializes the stack by setting 'top' to -1,
    // which represents an empty stack.
    ThreadSafeStack() : top(-1) {}

    // Delete copy constructor and copy assignment operator.
    // This prevents accidental copying of the stack, which would lead
    // to problems with the mutex and condition variables.
    ThreadSafeStack(const ThreadSafeStack&) = delete;
    ThreadSafeStack& operator=(const ThreadSafeStack&) = delete;

    // Push operation: Adds an item to the top of the stack.
    // It blocks if the stack is full until space becomes available.
    void push(const T& item) {
        // Lock the mutex using a unique_lock. This RAII mechanism ensures that
        // the lock is released automatically when the scope ends.
        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
        
        // Wait on the 'cond_full' condition variable until the stack is not full.
        // The lambda predicate checks that there is room (i.e., top < Size - 1).
        cond_full.wait(lock, [this] { return top < static_cast<int>(Size) - 1; });

        // Increment the 'top' index and add the item.
        data[++top] = item;
        std::cout << "Pushed: " << item << std::endl;

        // Notify one thread waiting on 'cond_empty' that there is now an item available.
        cond_empty.notify_one();
    }

    // Pop operation: Removes and returns the item from the top of the stack.
    // It blocks if the stack is empty until an item is available.
    T pop() {
        // Lock the mutex to ensure thread-safe access.
        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(mtx);

        // Wait on the 'cond_empty' condition variable until there is an item to pop.
        // The lambda predicate checks that the stack is not empty (top >= 0).
        cond_empty.wait(lock, [this] { return top >= 0; });

        // Retrieve the item and then decrement the 'top' index.
        T item = data[top--];
        std::cout << "Popped: " << item << std::endl;

        // Notify one thread waiting on 'cond_full' that there is now space available.
        cond_full.notify_one();
        return item;
    }

private:
    T data[Size];                       // Fixed-size array to hold the stack elements.
    int top;                            // Index of the current top element in the stack.
    std::mutex mtx;                     // Mutex to synchronize access to the stack.
    std::condition_variable cond_empty; // Condition variable to signal when the stack is not empty.
    std::condition_variable cond_full;  // Condition variable to signal when the stack is not full.
};

// Example usage with multiple threads to demonstrate producer-consumer scenario.
void producer(ThreadSafeStack<int, 5>& stack) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
        stack.push(i);  // Push values 0 to 9 onto the stack.
        // Sleep to simulate work and give the consumer a chance to run.
        std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(100));
    }
}

void consumer(ThreadSafeStack<int, 5>& stack) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
        stack.pop();  // Pop 10 items from the stack.
        // Sleep to simulate work and to allow the producer to push more items.
        std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(150));
    }
}

int main() {
    ThreadSafeStack<int, 5> stack;  // Create a stack that holds up to 5 integers.

    // Create two threads: one producer and one consumer.
    std::thread t1(producer, std::ref(stack));
    std::thread t2(consumer, std::ref(stack));

    // Wait for both threads to finish.
    t1.join();
    t2.join();

    return 0;
}
```

### Detailed Analysis & Reasoning Behind the Design

1. **Templates and Fixed Size:**
   - **Flexibility:** By templating the class, we allow the stack to work with any data type.
   - **Fixed Size:** The fixed-size array (`T data[Size]`) is simple and efficient but limits the capacity. This design is common in systems where resources are constrained or where predictability is key.

2. **Thread Safety with Mutexes and Condition Variables:**
   - **Mutex (`mtx`):** Ensures that only one thread can access or modify the shared data (the stack) at a time. This prevents race conditions.
   - **Condition Variables (`cond_empty` and `cond_full`):** Allow threads to wait for specific conditions:
     - **`cond_full`**: The producer waits if the stack is full.
     - **`cond_empty`**: The consumer waits if the stack is empty.
   - **Why Wait?** Instead of busy waiting (which wastes CPU cycles), threads sleep until they are notified that the condition has changed.

3. **RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) and `std::unique_lock`:**
   - **RAII Pattern:** Using `std::unique_lock` automatically locks the mutex when the lock is created and unlocks it when it goes out of scope, ensuring that locks are properly managed even if exceptions occur.

4. **Lambda Predicates in Condition Variables:**
   - **Purpose:** The lambda functions passed to `wait()` check if the condition for continuing (e.g., not full or not empty) is met. This makes the waiting process robust by re-checking the condition after the thread is awakened.
   - **Example:** In `push()`, the lambda checks that `top < Size - 1` to ensure there is space to add a new item.

5. **Blocking Behavior and Notification:**
   - **Blocking:** Both `push()` and `pop()` block until the required condition is met (i.e., not full or not empty), ensuring that operations only proceed when they can be performed safely.
   - **Notification:** After modifying the stack (either pushing or popping), a call to `notify_one()` wakes up one of the waiting threads. This is crucial to ensure that waiting threads re-check the condition and can proceed if appropriate.

6. **Deleted Copy Operations:**
   - **Safety:** Copying an object that contains a mutex and condition variables can lead to undefined behavior. By deleting the copy constructor and assignment operator, we prevent such issues and ensure that each instance of the stack is unique and safely managed.

7. **Producer-Consumer Example:**
   - **Simulated Work:** The use of `std::this_thread::sleep_for` in both the producer and consumer functions simulates work and gives a clear demonstration of how the blocking operations work in a multi-threaded environment.
   - **Thread Creation:** Threads are created using `std::thread` and the `std::ref` wrapper ensures that the stack is passed by reference, maintaining the shared state.

### Questions to Deepen Your Understanding

1. **Thread Synchronization:**
   - **Question:** Why is it important to use a mutex in both the `push()` and `pop()` methods? What could go wrong if we omitted the mutex?
   
2. **Condition Variables:**
   - **Question:** How do the lambda predicates in `cond_full.wait()` and `cond_empty.wait()` help in ensuring the correctness of our thread synchronization?
   - **Follow-up:** What might happen if you forgot to call `notify_one()` after pushing or popping an item?

3. **Resource Management:**
   - **Question:** Can you think of the benefits of using RAII (e.g., `std::unique_lock`) in this code compared to manually locking and unlocking the mutex?

4. **Design Trade-offs:**
   - **Question:** This implementation uses a fixed-size array for the stack. What are some advantages and disadvantages of this approach compared to using a dynamic data structure (like `std::vector`)?

5. **Error Handling and Edge Cases:**
   - **Question:** What are some potential pitfalls or edge cases in multi-threaded code like this, and how does this implementation mitigate them?
